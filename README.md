Login and Sign up form validation


There for now is a sign up and login validation using python-flask.
It recognises when you have logged in and your session starts until you log out or closes the browser.
SQLite database was used for this project, so you might want to run the schema.py first to create the database.

During the sign up form filling, one of the field requires the name of the dev's name, so it will be "golden".
